Using Python to Organize Photos Into Separate Folders

## Description: 
Have you ever had too many photos in one library. Does it feel like the shoebox under the bed? Well, just use this quick trick in python to make life easier. 

Using the OS module, I've created a way to quickly sort and manage my photo directories. 

### Code can be broken down into four steps: 
 - Get a list of the file names
 - Extract the place names from the file names
 - Make a directory for each place name
 - Move files into the right directories
